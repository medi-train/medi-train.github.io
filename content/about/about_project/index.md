#### Research Project MEDITRAIN founded by Croatian Science Foundation @FERIT

---

The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology (FERIT), Osijek, Croatia implements the research project funded by the Croatian Science Foundation, titled *Medical Education and Planning through Extended Reality (MEDITRAIN)*. 


**Project Overview:**

This project, led by Prof. Irena Galić, Ph.D., focuses on the development of novel methods and systems aimed at enhancing medical education and surgical planning for specific medical conditions and procedures. The goal is to create innovative approaches for simulation and analysis of medical images using machine learning algorithms to:

1. Improve clinicians’ understanding of placenta accreta and the importance of its detection during pregnancy, with the aim of reducing the rate of missed diagnoses during prenatal ultrasound examinations.
2. Enhance the feasibility and quality of cerebrovascular interventions through the development of detailed and realistic VR/XR simulations of specific neurosurgical procedures.

For the purpose of ultrasound examination simulations, the project will develop techniques for synthesizing realistic ultrasound images from MRI data by combining traditional and modern methods. In simulating cerebrovascular surgical procedures, the project plans to develop a method based on generative artificial intelligence that will create new, realistic, and complex cases depending on predefined medical parameters.

The project will result in a set of open-source software libraries containing all the methods developed throughout the project. The synthetic medical image generation techniques will enable the creation of diverse educational scenarios, while the VR/XR simulations will provide medical professionals with the opportunity to improve their skills in a safe environment.
